# Maryland Precipitation

Data source: NOAA - National Centers for Environmental Information

The Hourly Precipitation Dataset was downloaded in three parts through this website:
https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search?datasetid=PRECIP_HLY#

The three parts spanned 1951-1970, 1970-1990, and 1990-2014, and were downloaded
in sections to accommodate the size limit on the database downloader.

The data downloaded were specific to Maryland for this analysis, but
functionality should be maintained using data from other states.
